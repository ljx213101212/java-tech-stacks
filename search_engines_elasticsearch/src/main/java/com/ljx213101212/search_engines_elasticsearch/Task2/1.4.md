Question: Try the same with "name" : "Stepanie" and  "name" : "Stepanie Spain". Did you get the result? Why?

Answer:  Yes, both query won't get any results. Because by default,  text field uses Standard analyzer which will lowercase the
tokens and make the "Stepanie" into ["stepanie"] and "Stepanie Spain" into ["stepanie", "spain"] case-sensitively.

Support documentation:
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-term-query.html

```
By default, Elasticsearch changes the values of text fields during analysis. For example, the default standard analyzer changes text field values as follows:

Removes most punctuation
Divides the remaining content into individual words, called tokens
Lowercases the tokens -> [stepanie, spain]
```
