Question:
```commandline
1. Get employee with "name.keyword": "stepanie" using Terms query.
2. Try "name.keyword" : "Stepanie Spain". 
    2.1,2.2Review the difference between Match and Term queries as well as between text and keyword types search.
```

Answer:
```commandline
1. no result, name.keyword has no tokenizer mechanism, and is designated to do exact string match.
2.1 Has Result, because "Stepanie Spain" is identical to "Stepanie Spain" itself.
2.2  Both match and term has results for "Stephanie Spain" on "name.keyword" field.
Match Query is used for full-text search on "text" fields, more like a fuzzy search
Term Query is used for exact matching for the entire field value on "keyword" or unanaluzed fields, more like a pefect match search
